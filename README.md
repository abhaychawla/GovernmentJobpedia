# GovernmentJobpedia
This project involves creating a unified portal for the goverment to display a list of available vacancies and the users to view all the information and apply for the same.

Every Ministry and Government agencies have their own Recruitment Board which announces vacancies on separate mediums.
This project consists of an Android App and a web portal. The Android app displays the available jobs according to user preferences, while the Web Portal is built only to announce the available vacancies by various Ministries and Government agencies.

Successful completion of this project could help both the job posters and job seekers i.e. All the ministries and government agencies would have a standard place to announce job vacancies while the job seekers would get a single place to look for government jobs.
